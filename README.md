# EPIMOS
**Environmental Prediction and Imputation Modular Statistical System**

## Overview
EPIMOS (Environmental Prediction and Imputation Modular Statistical System) is a comprehensive framework designed to predict and impute missing environmental variables through a modular statistical approach. This system facilitates the preprocessing, modeling, and prediction of environmental data on both daily and yearly scales.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: The system is built with a modular approach, making it flexible and extensible.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles raw environmental data and prepares it for modeling and prediction.
- **Prediction Module**: Provides daily predictions of environmental variables.
- **Building Module**: Facilitates yearly updates and improvements to the prediction model.
- **Imputation**: Efficiently fills in missing data points in environmental datasets.

## Workflow
The system follows a multi-module development approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing Module**:
    - Processes OASI data.
    - Prepares data for modeling and prediction.

2. **Building Module** (Yearly):
    - Updates the model annually to improve accuracy and incorporate new data.

3. **Prediction Module** (Daily):
    - Provides daily predictions of environmental variables based on the processed data and updated model.
